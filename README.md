## Installation for instance admins

### Install Tangerine UI as the only theme on your instance:
* Copy & paste the contents of [`TangerineUI.css`](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon/blob/main/TangerineUI.css) to the **Custom CSS** field in the administration panel on your Mastodon instance (Navigate to https://*domain*/admin/settings/appearance).
   * ü™ª For the purple variant, copy the contents of [`TangerineUI-purple.css`](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon/blob/main/TangerineUI-purple.css) instead.
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution: Using the 'Custom CSS' field to apply Tangerine UI will prevent all users on your instance from being able to choose another theme in their settings.** Please make sure there is a consensus among your users for doing so. If not, see below how to install Tangerine UI as an optional site theme for your users.

### Install Tangerine UI as an optional theme on your instance [Recommended]:
1. Add the files and folders from [this repository](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-admins) to your Mastodon themes directory:

```
app/
  javascript/
    styles/
    tangerineui.scss                          | **new**
    tangerineui-purple.scss                   | **new**
      contrast/
        ...
      fonts/
        ...
      tangerineui/                            | **new**
        layout-single-column.scss             | **new**
      tangerineui-purple/                     | **new**
        layout-single-column.scss             | **new**
```


2. **Add your themes to the config.** This is what [the default themes.yml](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/config/themes.yml) looks like in Mastodon. To make Tangerine UI visible in your users's settings, you need to add a new line to [`themes.yml`](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/config/themes.yml) (`).

```yml
default: styles/application.scss
contrast: styles/contrast.scss
mastodon-light: styles/mastodon-light.scss
tangerineui: styles/tangerineui.scss                  | **new**
tangerineui-purple: styles/tangerineui-purple.scss    | **new**
```

3. **Add a human-friendly name for the themes (optional).** You can edit each desired language's locale file in `config/locales/[lang].yml` to add a localized string name for your theme's `themeName` as added in the previous step. For example, [the default `config/locales/en.yml`](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/041ff5fa9a45f7b8d1048a05a35611622b6f5fdb/config/locales/en.yml#L942-L945) contains localizations for the three default themes that ship with Mastodon, into the `en`glish language. You need to do this for every language you expect your users to use, or else they will see the unlocalized `themeName` directly.

```yml
themes:
  contrast: Mastodon (High contrast)
  default: Mastodon (Dark)
  mastodon-light: Mastodon (Light)
  tangerineui: Tangerine UI                           | **new**
  tangerineui-purple: Tangerine UI (Purple)           | **new**
```

4. **Compile theme assets and restart.** Run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` and restart your Mastodon instance for the changes to take effect.


## Installation for regular users:
* Install a browser extension that allows you to inject CSS on a webpage, such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html), or [Live CSS Editor](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor)
* Copy & paste the contents of [`TangerineUI.css`](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon/blob/main/TangerineUI.css) to the extension's editor
   * ü™ª For the purple variant, copy the contents of [`TangerineUI-purple.css`](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon/blob/main/TangerineUI-purple.css) instead.

## Things to know
* **Tangerine UI currently only supports Mastodon's single column layout**. The advanced view (multiple columns) will not be affected.
* **Tangerine UI auto-switches from light to dark mode based on your OS preference**, whether you set your Mastodon theme to *Mastodon (Dark)* or *Mastodon (Light*).
* Check your Mastodon instance version before using. The latest Mastodon release checked to be compatible is indicated in the CSS file header.
* **Glitch-soc** and **Hometown** instance admins beware: Tangerine UI is currently only meant to be applied to Mastodon's vanilla Dark and Light themes.
    * If you are a user on a Glitch-soc instance using a browser extension, first switch your instance to the vanilla flavour before applying Tangerine UI.

## Accessibility
* I have not yet adapted Tangerine to Mastodon's *High Contrast* theme setting. Please consider that some of your users may depend on it.

## Credits
Huge thanks to [Roni Laukkarinen](https://mementomori.social/@rolle) whose work on [Mastodon Bird UI](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui) I adapted for multiple parts of the redesign. The icon replacement implementations I have also adapted from Bird UI.
